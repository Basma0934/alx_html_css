        <p>AI loves data, but many enterprises are still scratching the surface. While significant advancements have been made
          in AI, locating, accessing and processing data across disparate environments remains a major roadblock.
          Organizations need help with the rapid growth of data (and its copies) across multicloud, proliferating data sources,
          formats and tool choices, and an inability to scale as requirements grow.
          This prevents them from fully unlocking the potential of AI to drive business outcomes.</p>
        <p>Since most data remains on-premises, customers are left with two broad (both suboptimal) choices—either stitch
          together a complex web of tools and technologies and manage it on their own or replicate their entire data estate to
          the public cloud.</p>
        <p>Organizations are stuck between a rock and a hard place and deserve a better answer. An answer that works with their
          data gravity and not against it, doesn't force them to undertake a multi-year journey to centralize all their data in
          the public cloud or constantly play catch up to the myriad choices of proprietary and open-source technologies.
          And while we're at it, an answer that works for their current analytics and AI needs and emerging GenAI needs. We call
          this “AI anywhere on data everywhere.”</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, <a
            href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/find-the-needle-in-the-multicloud-data-haystack/">together</a> with Starburst,
          Dell Technologies <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/find-the-needle-in-the-multicloud-data-haystack/">started
            working</a> on this.
          We heard customers across the spectrum tell us about their challenges and needs—and we listened.</p>
